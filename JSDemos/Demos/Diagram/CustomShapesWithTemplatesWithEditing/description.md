In this demo, the [customShapeTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/#customShapeTemplate) option defines a common shape template and adds the **Edit** and **Delete** links to a shape. These links allow users to modify and remove employee data in the data source. The [reloadContent](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Methods/#reloadContentitemKey_applyLayout) method is called on every data source change. This method reloads the modified diagram elements from the data source and recreates the [diagram layout](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Diagram/Data_Binding/#Diagram_Layout).

The [customDataExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/nodes/#customDataExpr) option links custom employee information from the data source to diagram nodes. Changes in the data are reflected in the diagram history. Users can utilize the UI to undo and redo these changes.

The [CustomShapeToolboxTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/#customShapeToolboxTemplate) option specifies a template for a shape in the toolbox.
