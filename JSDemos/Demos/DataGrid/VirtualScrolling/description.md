Virtual scrolling enables users to scroll grid records in order or jump to any record. In this mode, records are loaded when they get into the viewport and removed once they leave it.

To enable virtual scrolling, set the **scrolling**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/scrolling/#mode) to *"virtual"*.

In this demo, the **DataGrid** is bound to a local dataset of 100,000 records. Thanks to virtual scrolling, you can scroll to any record without lag.
