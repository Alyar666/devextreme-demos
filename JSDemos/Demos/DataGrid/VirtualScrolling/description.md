Virtual scrolling enables users to scroll the dataset page by page or jump to any page. In this mode, rows are loaded when they get into the viewport and removed once they leave it.

To enable virtual scrolling, set the **scrolling**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/scrolling/#mode) to *"virtual"*.

In this demo, the **DataGrid** is bound to a dataset of 100,000 records. Thanks to virtual scrolling, you can scroll to any record without lag.
