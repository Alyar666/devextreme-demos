<a href="https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs" target="_blank">ExcelJS</a> library allows you to customize worksheets outside of the exported cell area. 

In this demo pivot grid uses the information about the rows and columns, defined in the fields to add additional rows and columns titles to the exported file.
It also adds the custom header (a title before exported data) and a footer (a note after exported data). 

Review the [onExporting](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/#onExporting) handler to see the data export code.
