# DevExtreme Demos
 
The DevExtreme Demos repository contains DevExtreme technical demos for Angular, React, Vue, jQuery, ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core approaches.

If you need to run the demos locally, clone this repository and follow the instructions below.

## Install required packages and prepare demos

Run the following command to prepare all demos:
 
```
npm install
npm run prepare-all
```
Use `npm run prepare-js` command to prepare only Javascript based demos, `npm run prepare-mvc` for ASP.NET MVC demos and `npm run prepare-netcore` for ASP.NET Core demos.

## Add and launch Javascript based demos

Run `npm run run-demo` command to launch a demo. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. 
Run `npm run add-demo` to add a demo. In both cases choose or write a category, a demo and an approach using built-in cli.

## Add and launch ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core demos

Launch ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core projects and edit or add demo using Visual Studio.
